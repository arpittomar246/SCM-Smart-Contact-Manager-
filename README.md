# SCM-Smart-Contact-Manager-

The Smart Contact Manager is a sophisticated web application designed to efficiently manage and organize contacts. This application leverages the powerful Java programming language and the Spring Boot framework to deliver a robust and scalable solution.

Key Features:

1.User Authentication and Authorization:
  -Secure login and registration system using Spring Security.
  -Role-based access control ensuring data privacy and integrity.

2.Contact Management:
  -Add, update, delete, and search contacts.
  -Categorize contacts with tags for easy organization.

3.Responsive User Interface:
  -Intuitive and user-friendly design using Thymeleaf templates.
  -Responsive design to ensure compatibility with various devices and screen sizes.

4.Data Storage:
  -Persistent data storage using Hibernate and JPA.
  -Integration with a relational database (e.g., MySQL).

5.RESTful APIs:
  -Expose RESTful endpoints for performing CRUD operations on contacts.
  -JSON format for API responses to facilitate easy integration with other services.

6.Validation and Error Handling:
  -Comprehensive validation of user inputs.
  -Graceful error handling and user feedback for a seamless experience.

Technologies Used:

Java: Core programming language.
Spring Boot: Framework for building the application.
Spring Security: For authentication and authorization.
Hibernate & JPA: For database interaction.
Thymeleaf: Template engine for dynamic web pages.
MySQL: Database for storing contact data.

Project Workflow:

1.Set up the Spring Boot project with the necessary dependencies.
2.Implement user authentication and authorization usi  ng Spring Security.
3.Develop the contact management functionality, including CRUD operations.
4.Design a responsive and intuitive user interface using Thymeleaf.
5.Implement data storage and ensure database connectivity with Hibernate and JPA.
6.Create RESTful APIs for contact management.
7.Test the application thoroughly and handle any errors gracefully.

This project serves as a comprehensive example of using modern Java and Spring Boot technologies to build a real-world web application with a focus on security, scalability, and user experience.
